# 3D Pac-man

## About

This is the final project for my CS385 (Computer Graphics) course. It is an implementation of the popular game [Pac-man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) using three.js.

## Tech-Stack

The backend is implemented using Python and Flask. The frontend is setup using Vanilla JavaScript and Three.JS.
